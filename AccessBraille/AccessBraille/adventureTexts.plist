	<key>nameRequest</key>
	<string>What is the name of your character?</string>
	<key>crashSite</key>
	<string>Your time machine has stopped functioning and you&apos;re stranded sometime in the past. It looks like you&apos;ve landed in the wilderness somewhere. There&apos;s something shiny in the distance.</string>
	<key>crashSiteLeave</key>
	<string>You walk forward under the forest canopy towards the distant sparkling object. </string>
	<key>forestFloor</key>
	<string>You&apos;re surrounded by trees everywhere deep in some forest. You see a cabin ahead of you and your broken time machine behind you.</string>
	<key>forestFloorPickup</key>
	<string>It&apos;s a shiny key! I wonder what it unlocks...</string>
	<key>forestFloorLeave</key>
	<string>You push onwards to the cabin&apos;s faint glow...</string>
	<key>secretCabin</key>
	<string>You&apos;ve made it to the cabin, but the door is locked!</string>
	<key>secretCabinLeave</key>
	<string>You creep through the unlocked door into the small cabin.</string>
	<key>secretCabinBlock</key>
	<string>You slam your weight against the door but it doesn&apos;t budge. Unlocking the door looks like the only way to proceed...</string>
	<key>keyUse</key>
	<string>You carefully insert the key into the keyhole. It fits! The door drifts open.</string>
	<key>cabinFloor</key>
	<string>A crackling fireplace warms the small cabin. Someone was probably just here...You notice a small chest in the corner of the room. Through the window you see the edge of a lake...</string>
	<key>pickBlock</key>
	<string>There&apos;s nothing to pick up here...</string>
	<key>cabinFloorPuzzle</key>
	<string>You walk over to the chest, and notice that it&apos;s protected by a password. However, there&apos;s a message on the side of the chest: &apos;wind&apos;. Maybe if you type the message the chest will unlock...</string>
	<key>cabinFloorPickup</key>
	<string>The chest slowly creaks open. The password worked! Inside lies a single object: a sail. You pick up the sail and stuff it in your pack.</string>
	<key>cabinFloorLeave</key>
	<string>You walk out the cabin door and start heading to the lake.</string>
	<key>lake</key>
	<string>You&apos;ve made it to the lake and a boat lies in front of you. The wind is blowing towards a rocky outcrop in the distance.</string>
	<key>lakePickup</key>
	<string>You climb into the small vessel and attach the sail. Almost immediately, the wind magically starts taking you towards the rocky outcrop.</string>
	<key>darkCave</key>
	<string>The sail carried you all the way across the lake to the entrance of a dark cave. You step out of the boat and head inside. It&apos;s quite dark but something&apos;s protruding out of the ground.</string>
	<key>darkCavePickup</key>
	<string>The object protruding out of the ground is a flashlight! You grab it and quickly flip it on to light up the cave.</string>
	<key>darkCaveLeave</key>
	<string>Hopeful that you&apos;ll find some silver to power the machine, you venture into the depths of the cave.</string>
	<key>finalCavern</key>
	<string>After what seems like miles of trudging through the cave, the path opens up into a giant cavern and you can&apos;t believe your eyes... the room is covered in gold, rubies, and silver!</string>
	<key>finalCavernPickup</key>
	<string>You grab enough silver and cram it into your pack. You&apos;ll be able to return home! You rush out of the cavern, hop into the boat, and sail back to the cabin.</string>
	<key>exit</key>
	<string>You make it back to the time machine right before the sun completely sets. You stuff the silver into the engine and hop inside. With dials set to 2020, you slam the go button and warp back into the future.</string>
