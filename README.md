Accessbraille
=============

A braille accessibility and learning app for iOS.

The idea behind AccessBraille is to introduce the practice of typing in the Grade 1 braille typeface to young children (seeing and blind) in an interactive and engaging way. 

The idea is to eventually have interactive games that encourage users to learn how to type in the Grade 1 braille system.
